# Hiya!

My name is Erica Ferrua EdwardsdÃ³ttir. I study numbers (currently on 722), and am very interested in counting stuff. 
I occasionally develop things that I think are cool and/or useful. Here are a few of my favs:

- [chafa.py](https://github.com/GuardKenzie/chafa.py/) â€” Python bindings for [Chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/) - visualize images in the terminal using Python.
- [Landra](https://github.com/GuardKenzie/landra/) â€” An event management Discord bot written in [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).
- [PokÃ©dex](https://pokedex.mage.black/) â€” A recreation of the PokÃ©dex from PokÃ©mon Platinum, running in your browser, powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
- [Kaffi](https://mage.black/kaffi/) â€” A website for the coffee recipes I use
- [Booz](https://mage.black/booz/) â€” A website where I collect cocktail recipes, powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

If you want to talk to me, the best way is to add me on Discord (@tolvukisa) or you can email me on e@mage.black

Have fun!<br>
